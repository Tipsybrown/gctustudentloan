<div id="class">Testimonial by Lord Listowell<br>
“Students loan came in when I was financially distressed. A colleague beneficiary introduced it to me when I called on him for support to settle my school fees. I quickly acquired the necessary requirements like the E-Zwich card, grabbed a copy of the application forms at Accra Technical University Zonal office of SLTF to apply.
I had initial challenges with the details I provided and I was called to rectify it to aid the processing of the loan. One faithful afternoon when all my dreams were shattered, my phone rang, so I hurriedly took my phone to see who sent me a message. To my surprise, the message was “Kindly go to the bank, load your E-Zwich Card and withdraw “.
I was speechless for a minute. Thank you SLTF for this support.</div>

“During my second year in school, the future of my education looked very bleak. I had no support from anywhere because my father was deceased. I was introduced to the SLTF by a friend who happens to be a beneficiary.
It took only two weeks for the money to be paid after I have applied for the loan. As a result of this facility I was able to cater for my residential fees, other academic expenses like cost of books, printing of study materials and used some for my personal upkeep.
In fact, I must say, the loan was my saviour. I encourage all and sundry to take advantage of the student’s loan as it will alleviate untold hardship on you, so that you can concentrate on your studies without thinking about how to finance your education.’’</div>

<div id="class" style="background-color:aqua">Testimonial by Emmanuel<br>I applied for the students’ loan in my second year when I was in financial difficulties on campus. Back then at school, if your school fees is not paid on time it consequently attracts some penalty, and you have no choice but to pay.

The students loan readily assisted me to bridge that financial gap. I used the loan amount to avoid payment of those penalties during the rest of my study in school. I advise fellow students that the loan is available to assist us meet some of our educational expenses whilst on campus. So do not wait till you’re in any dire financial situations before you apply.
