<h3>TESTIMONIES OF OUR BENEFICIARIES</h3>

<div id="class">Testimonial By Enoch<br>
Students Loan Trust Fund. Wow!… I have benefited a lot from SLTF that is why I always say “wow!” when I hear SLTF. I started benefiting from the students’ loan indirectly even from the days that I was not a beneficiary. You may ask, how! “…when I entered the University, I realized that most students on campus were not conversant with the entire process of the loan, besides, since there was no SLTF office on my campus, students always have to travelled all the way to Winneba on several occasions at some substantial cost just to get information on how to complete the loan application process.
I therefore took it upon myself to know all that it takes to apply for the loan and started helping my colleagues with the online application processes. Some of the students realizing the voluntary and good services I am rendering them started rewarding me in cash and kind. This really helped me to buy books and paid for other academic expenses. This same service led to my appointment as Student loan representative on campus and students voted me as a NUGS President on campus as well.
During my third year, I applied for the loan because things became tough for me in terms of finances. Had it not been for the students’ loan, I might have deferred my program; so Glory Be To God for SLTF.
My advice for students is that; SLTF is the only institution that helps to support financing of your educational expenses without any worries till completion of school. Though the loan comes with some interest, trust me, no financial institution will ever give you loan for such a long term at that little interest rate. NB: Please do not apply for the loan if you don’t desperately need it or manage without it, so that other more needy students could access it. Thank You SLTF.’’

<div id="class" style="background-color:turquoise"> Testimonial By Amina<br>
“When I was in my second year in school, all hope was lost as my parents could no longer cater for my education and other expenses due to financial problems.
Surprisingly, SLTF wiped away my tears as I do not have to worry about how to pay for my school fees, books, hostel and other expenses. Since then I became fully concentrated on my studies. After application, it took me just less than three weeks to receive my money.
I must say that, SLTF has been of great assistance to me because it is the secret behind my success today. It is real and I urge all students who need financial support for their educational to also apply.’’

<div id="class" style="background-color:wheat">Testimonial from Georgina<br>
“I am a proud beneficiary of the Students Loan Trust Fund. It provided me the opportunity to be more conscious and responsible for my studies rather than going to and fro in search for money to cater for my expenses.
Further the loan reduced the financial burden on my parents as I used most of it to purchase my books, food and even pay my accommodation fees.
Besides all these numerous benefits, SLTF loan offered a greater flexibility, and more manageable terms and conditions than other standard non-education loans from the commercial banks.
I therefore encourage other needy tertiary students to apply for student’s loan from SLTF to enjoy the above benefits and even more while in school.”

<div id="class" style="background-color:aqua">Testimonial By Comfort<br>
“Whilst on campus things grew really tough for me. Paying my fees became a challenge. My brother who was supporting my tertiary education, heard about Students’ Loan Trust Fund and assisted me in applying for the loan. The money came just at the right time and thanks to the SLTF I was able to complete university stress free.
I therefore entreat all and sundry who are in tertiary institutions and going through tough financial crisis to apply and gain some financial relief through the student’s loan.’’
